# Digital-Mailroom

**The monorepo: every constellation package in one checkout and one virtualenv.**

## What it does

Digital-Mailroom holds all ten constellation packages under `packages/` as git subtrees, each with its own history, wired into a single `uv` workspace with one `uv.lock`. A contributor clones one repository, runs `uv sync`, and has every package installed editable with no cross-repo import juggling.

It also carries the governance tooling for the whole family: the cross-repo task board, the served Dispatch Board, label and taxonomy drift checks, and the hub release chain.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LLM-Mailroom-Services/Digital-Mailroom.git
cd Digital-Mailroom
uv sync
uv run pytest packages/llm-mailroom/src/tests   # one package per invocation
```

## Rules worth knowing

* Member `pyproject.toml` files keep their published git pins. Workspace redirection happens only through `[tool.uv.sources]`, so `pip install .` inside a package still builds the release.
* Nested `.github/workflows/` inside packages do not run here.
* Heavy assets (example PDFs, screenshots, report archives) are pruned; tests that need them skip.
* Stage explicit paths only; never `git add .` in the shared checkout.
