# llm-mailroom-graph

**An interactive knowledge graph of the pipeline's code, for answering "what calls what" questions.**

| Live site     | [exios66.github.io/llm-mailroom-graph](https://exios66.github.io/llm-mailroom-graph/) |
| Monorepo path | `packages/llm-mailroom-graph` (virtual member, static site)                           |
| Built with    | [graphify](https://github.com/Graphify-Labs/graphify), AST-only, no LLM tokens        |

## What it does

The site maps llm-mailroom's production code (agents, graph, pipeline, API, storage, observability, LLM layer, schemas, scripts) as a walkable graph: about 1,900 symbols and 4,500 edges grouped into communities. Tests, notebooks and docs are excluded.

| Architecture map (`index.html`) | Layers, then modules, then symbols, with a strip that jumps to the 13 pipeline nodes |
| Module tree (`tree.html`)       | The same graph as a collapsible file tree                                            |
| Report (`report.html`)          | Central nodes, communities, bridges, suggested questions                             |
| Classic view (`graph.html`)     | graphify's force-directed canvas                                                     |

## When to use it

Use it to find structure quickly: where a function is called from, which modules a node depends on. It is a build artifact, so when it disagrees with the source code or the board, the source and the board win.

## Rebuilding

The README has the exact commands: clone llm-mailroom, run `graphify extract` and `graphify cluster-only`, then `scripts/regenerate_graph_site.py` to rebuild `index.html` and `report.html`.
