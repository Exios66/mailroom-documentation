# LLM-MAILROOM

**A multi-agent pipeline that ingests, classifies, extracts, and archives legal documents — with a full audit trail.**

One LangGraph state machine per document. Specialist LLM agents per document class. Hash-chained audit log. Provider-agnostic LLM layer. Traced end-to-end.

This is the published home of [The Digital Mailroom](https://mailroom-inc.gitbook.io/the-digital-mailroom/). It is the GitBook port of the static landing page (banner, title, badges, tags, install, pipeline walk-through, docs shelf). Fumi appears after the masthead as Postal Worker Fumi (文, "letter") on duty. GitBook strips scripts, so the idle mail-floor terminal stays on the static page. This page uses GitBook's own type — it does not load the landing page's display font.

```bash
# clone, install, then start the API (it embeds the inbox watcher)
git clone https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom.git
cd llm-mailroom
pip install -e ".[dev]"
PYTHONPATH=src python -m api.main
```

## From inbox to archive

The happy path costs two LLM generations. Everything else is procedural, gated, or a human's call.

| Stop         | What happens                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Intake**   | The watcher claims the upload by atomic rename into `processing/`, transcribes it, and cleans it. Nothing is ever truncated.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Classify** | The sorter picks one of five classes. At `0.97` or above it goes straight on. Between `0.88` and `0.97` it gets one re-classification pass, then a second-opinion reviewer agent (Lane A). Below `0.88` it retries, then goes to human review. Contracts, merger agreements and insurance claims use stricter per-class thresholds (`0.98` and `0.90`) because a wrong auto-pass costs more there. |
| **Extract**  | The class specialist fills its schema. Guardrails check the JSON before anything moves forward.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Verify**   | Extractions in the ambiguous confidence band get a judge, then an arbiter. Conflicts go to the boss agent or a human. See the [Pipeline flowchart](the-pipeline-in-depth/flowchart.md).                                                                                                                                             |
| **Archive**  | A procedural report, a catalog row in SQLite, and an archive entry sealed into the hash-chained audit log.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## What ships with it

|                           |                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Five document classes** | Contracts, merger agreements, corporate records, correspondence, and insurance claims, each with its own specialist. |
| **Any model provider**    | OpenRouter, Ollama, or vLLM. Agents ask for a role; `taxonomy.yaml` decides the model.                               |
| **Traced end to end**     | Langfuse, Braintrust, or a local Arize Phoenix. The pipeline runs fine with none of them.                            |
| **Evaluation built in**   | A 23-sample pilot with ground truth, deterministic field scoring, LLM judges, and a LegalBench harness.              |

## Where to start

**One place to learn the Mailroom constellation: the llm-mailroom pipeline and every repository built around it.**

The Mailroom reads legal and business documents, works out what each one is, pulls the important fields out of it, and files it in an archive with a tamper-evident audit trail. A team of specialist LLM agents does the work, one state machine per document.

That system is spread across more than a dozen repositories: the pipeline itself, a scoring library, an evaluation harness, corpus builders, a local sandbox, two visualizers, an ML classifier, and the monorepo that ties them together. This site is the front door to all of them.
