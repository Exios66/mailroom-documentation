## What it plans to do

Keep only the plumbing that a local end-to-end run, an evaluation against `mailroom-dataset`, and GPU serving need. A document dropped in `inbox/` is classified, extracted, reported, catalogued and archived with a verifiable SHA-256 audit chain. The design lists six success criteria. Two stand out:

* A clean text-layer document costs exactly **2 LLM calls** (sorter and specialist). A deterministic route gate replaces the reviewer LLM nodes.
* `mailroom eval` reproduces the SAND-37 card. Specialists use the frozen v1 prompts byte for byte.

## How it differs from llm-mailroom

| Concern | llm-mailroom | mailroom-reloaded (planned) |
| ------- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| Orchestration | LangGraph | CrewAI Flows |
| Tracing | Langfuse (default), Braintrust, Phoenix | OpenTelemetry to Phoenix, with Prometheus and Grafana for metrics |
| Model access | LiteLLM gateway, OpenRouter, vLLM, llamafile | OpenAI-compatible endpoints only: `llamafile`, `openrouter`, `vllm`, `mock` |
| Primary classifier | LLM sorter, optional [ModernBERT](mailroom-ml.md) fast path | ModernBERT first, fail-open, with a sorter that adapts to the BERT verdict |
| Review nodes | Reviewer LLM nodes | A deterministic route gate with calibrated confidence |
| Scoring | `llm-dojo-scoring` as a dependency | A vendored slim subset of dojo v0.21.0 |
| Storage | Bins, manifests, optional Postgres | Bins, manifests and SQLite |

## Out of scope in the design

Gmail intake and triage, the relations scan, legalbench, Postgres, the [The-Mailroom](the-mailroom.md) visualizer (it reads Langfuse only), the free-model swarm and quota, Ollama, and prompt mutation lineage beyond frozen v1.

## When to use it

Use [llm-mailroom](llm-mailroom.md) for every real run today. Watch this repository if you need the smaller stack. When code lands, this page needs a status update and a version pin.
