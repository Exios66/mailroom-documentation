# Digital-Mailroom

**The monorepo: every constellation package in one checkout and one virtualenv.**

|            |                                                                                                          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Repository | [LLM-Mailroom-Services/Digital-Mailroom](https://github.com/LLM-Mailroom-Services/Digital-Mailroom)      |
| Role       | Hub; development source of truth for cross-repo work                                                     |
| Live board | [Dispatch Board](https://digital-mailroom-theta.vercel.app)                                              |

## What it does

Digital-Mailroom holds all ten constellation packages under `packages/` as git subtrees, each with its own history, wired into a single `uv` workspace with one `uv.lock`. A contributor clones one repository, runs `uv sync`, and has every package installed editable with no cross-repo import juggling.

It also carries the governance tooling for the whole family: the cross-repo task board, the served Dispatch Board, label and taxonomy drift checks, and the hub release chain.

## Monorepo versus standalone repositories

The hub is the place to plan cross-repo work, but its package copies can trail the standalone repositories. As of 2026-10-08 (hub v0.7.0, last commit 2026-09-26):

| Package | In the hub | Standalone repository |
| ------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| llm-mailroom | 0.7.1, pins llm-dojo-scoring v0.15.0 | 0.8.0, pins v0.21.0 |
| llm-dojo-scoring | 0.16.0 | v0.21.0 |
| The-Mailroom | 0.4.0 | 0.5.0 |

Run `python scripts/sync_packages.py status` before you rely on a package copy. The standalone repositories remain the release vehicles for deployed surfaces. Do not quote a hub package version as the current release.

The hub's `[Unreleased]` changelog also records that `.github/workflows/ci.yml` was removed. The per-package pytest matrix was disabled yet still registered as a required check. Verification is local, per `docs/TESTING.md`. Governance gates stay in `board-governance.yml`.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LLM-Mailroom-Services/Digital-Mailroom.git
cd Digital-Mailroom
uv sync
uv run pytest packages/llm-mailroom/src/tests   # one package per invocation
```

## Rules worth knowing

* Member `pyproject.toml` files keep their published git pins. Workspace redirection happens only through `[tool.uv.sources]`, so `pip install .` inside a package still builds the release.
* Nested `.github/workflows/` inside packages do not run here.
* Heavy assets (example PDFs, screenshots, report archives) are pruned; tests that need them skip.
* Stage explicit paths only; never `git add .` in the shared checkout.
