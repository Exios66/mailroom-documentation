# The-Mailroom

**A pixel-art visual engine that draws every pipeline run as envelopes on a conveyor, driven only by Langfuse traces.**

## What it does

The-Mailroom renders the pipeline as a mailroom floor: sorter, specialist bays, judge gate, boss's desk, reporter and archive, grouped into three rooms, with a human-review siding. Click an envelope to inspect its full run.

| Pixel-art console  | `mailroom-web` → `http://127.0.0.1:8001/`                              |
| Hosted Observatory | `mailroom-hosted`, or `/live` on the same server                       |
| TUI                | `mailroom-tui`                                                         |
| Terminal site      | `/terminal/` on GitHub Pages, with a dataset viewer and a repo browser |

Console tabs: FLOOR, REVIEW (approve, reject, requeue, correct the class), INSPECTOR (span timeline, model, tokens, cost), SESSIONS, HISTORY with REPLAY, METRICS (including first-pass rate) and CONSOLE.

## How it connects to the pipeline

* **Langfuse is the only data source.** Every envelope, badge, verdict and metric comes from the pipeline's Langfuse project. Demo mode seeds synthetic runs into Langfuse rather than bypassing it.
* **It calls back into the pipeline API** for operator actions. Set `MAILROOM_PIPELINE_URL`, `MAILROOM_PIPELINE_TOKEN` and `MAILROOM_PIPELINE_API_PREFIX=/v1`. Queue a document posts to `/v1/upload`; REVIEW buttons call the pipeline's review-resolve endpoints. Producer keys never reach the browser.
* **Schema mirror duty.** When the pipeline changes spans, node order, agents, classes, thresholds or judge score names, update `mailroom_ui/pipeline_schema.py` and `mailroom_ui/trace_interpreter.py` in the same change window. `MAILROOM_TAXONOMY` can point at the pipeline's `taxonomy.yaml` directly.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
cp .env.example .env      # LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY / LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY
mailroom-web              # pixel console on :8001
mailroom-tui              # typed-command console
```

Optional extras: `[pipeline]` (imports llm-mailroom for review resolve), `[operator]` (operator desk with auth, archive and observer), and a React desk under `ui/` that needs Node.
