## What it does

llm-mailroom runs one LangGraph state machine per document across 13 nodes: intake, classify, retry classify, review classify, extract, retry extract, judge, arbiter, human review, boss escalation, compile report, write catalog, archive. On the happy path a document costs two LLM calls (classify and extract). Everything else is a safety net that only fires when confidence is low or results conflict.

It exposes a FastAPI service (port 8000) that embeds the inbox watcher, accepts uploads, reports status and serves the audit trail. The same API is the "producer" The-Mailroom calls for its Inbox and REVIEW desk.

## Key ideas

* **The taxonomy is the single source of truth.** Document classes, thresholds, agent-to-model mapping and token caps all live in `config/taxonomy.yaml`. Nothing is hardcoded.
* **Provider-agnostic.** Every LLM call goes through `get_llm(agent_name)`. OpenRouter is the default; local providers are a configuration change (see [Local models](../../pipeline-reference-llm-mailroom/local-models.md)).
* **SQLite first.** The catalog, audit log and optional checkpoints are plain SQLite files. Postgres is opt-in.
* **Traced end to end.** Langfuse, Braintrust or Arize Phoenix, chosen automatically from available keys. Tracing never silently turns off.
* **No truncation.** Long documents are read in overlapping windows, never cut.
