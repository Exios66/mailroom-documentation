# llm-dojo-scoring

**The shared scoring library. The one place the constellation defines what "correct" means.**

## What it does

llm-dojo-scoring replaced each project's local scoring code with one importable library, so a number means the same thing in every repo. It scores extraction field by field according to the field's type, scores classification with proper per-class statistics and confidence intervals, and adds error analysis, cost accounting and reporting on top.

| Field type    | How it is scored                                                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | Normalize, then exact match                                          |
| `date`        | Parse to ISO, then exact match ("March 3, 2024" equals "03/03/2024") |
| `money`       | Strip symbols, compare within one cent                               |
| `label`       | Canonicalize, then exact match; no partial credit                    |
| `name`        | Jaro-Winkler plus token-set ratio                                    |
| `free_text`   | SQuAD-style token F1                                                 |
| `entity_list` | Hungarian bipartite matching, then precision, recall and F1          |

The `llm_dojo_scoring.intents` module holds the controlled `intent` vocabulary (`INTENT_LABELS`) and the `normalize_intent` mapper for `corporate_record`, `correspondence` and `insurance_claim`. The `production_prompts` catalog serves the five frozen v1 specialist prompts that llm-mailroom loads at runtime. The `production` family is a verbatim copy of the live llm-mailroom prompts, including the classification prompts, for dojo evaluation. The Sorter is not in the catalog; it stays on `sorter_v14` through `get_managed_prompt` (as of 2026-10-07).

An optional embedding similarity "rescues" names and free text that are worded differently but mean the same thing. A blank prediction is never rescued.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install "llm-dojo-scoring @ git+https://github.com/Exios66/llm-dojo-scoring.git@v0.21.0"
pip install -e ".[embeddings]"   # optional extras: embeddings, tracing, dev, all
```

```python
import llm_dojo_scoring as dojo

suite = dojo.get_suite("insurance_claims_specialist")   # one suite per pipeline agent
result = suite.score(expected_fields, predicted_fields)

ci = dojo.bootstrap_ci([1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0])
```

Command-line tools: `dojo-analyze` (report on a results workbook), `dojo-export` (rebuild workbooks from an experiment log), `dojo-sync` (pull live runs from Langfuse or Phoenix).

## How it is consumed

llm-mailroom pins it as a git dependency. When dojo publishes a release, a workflow in llm-mailroom (`bump-dojo-scoring.yml`) opens a pull request that bumps the pin. Inside the monorepo, every package resolves it to the workspace copy instead.
