## What it does

The repository analyzes the full CMS 2008 to 2010 DE-SynPUF Sample 1 (about 11.15 million claim events across inpatient, outpatient, carrier and prescription files, linked to 116,352 beneficiaries) and renders each sampled event as an Explanation of Benefits document. Ground-truth fields line up with the pipeline's `InsuranceClaimExtraction` schema. Source dataset: [CMS DE-SynPUF](https://cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/medicare-claims-synthetic-public-use-files/cms-2008-2010-data-entrepreneurs-synthetic-public-use-file-de-synpuf); this repository's own counts are in [`reports/`](https://github.com/Exios66/claims-data-eda/tree/main/reports) and the recovered archives are sha256-pinned in `data/raw/MANIFEST.json`.

Things worth knowing:

* **Costs are heavy-tailed**, so the sampler buckets on log-cost and keeps at least 15% high-cost claims per type.
* **Three of the source archives are no longer hosted by CMS** and were recovered from Internet Archive captures. Every ZIP is sha256-recorded in `data/raw/MANIFEST.json`.
* **CMS ground truth is homogeneous** (claims are all approved), so `determination_consistency` is treated as a quality KPI rather than a discriminating benchmark. The canonical dataset adds other insurance sources (GNOTHEIA, BDR, INSURBIAS) for variety.
