# Maintaining this site

{% hint style="info" %}
**About this site** is for maintainers of this GitBook. Readers of the pipeline docs do not need it.
{% endhint %}

**This repository — [Exios66/mailroom-documentation](https://github.com/Exios66/mailroom-documentation) — is the source of [The Digital Mailroom](https://mailroom-inc.gitbook.io/the-digital-mailroom/).** GitBook [Git Sync](https://gitbook.com/docs/getting-started/git-sync) publishes the site from the `docs/` folder. The pipeline that the site describes stays in [Exios66/llm-mailroom](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom).

## Publish a change

1. Edit Markdown under `docs/` only.
2. If you add a page, add a line for the page to `docs/SUMMARY.md`. GitBook publishes only the pages listed there.
3. Use relative links between pages on this site. Use full GitHub URLs for other repositories.
4. Run the checker from the repository root: `uv run --no-project --with pyyaml python3 scripts/check_site.py`. Fix every `ERROR` line. The last line must read `CHECK-OK`.
5. Run the style report on each page you changed: `python3 scripts/check_style.py docs/<page>.md -v`. Fix the findings in the sentences you changed.
6. If you changed a value that a chart shows, update the chart (see [Charts](#charts)).
7. Merge to `main`. Git Sync republishes the site.
8. Open the live page. Make sure that the page shows and its links resolve.

Do not edit `gitbook-docs.yaml` for a content change. If you must change the site structure, read [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/Exios66/mailroom-documentation/blob/main/AGENTS.md) first.

## Three rules that keep the site live

| Rule | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Keep the space `mailroom-docs` **inside** the section `section-1` | The site has a section. GitBook then refuses a space at the top level of `site.structure`, with the error `Root-level site spaces can only exist in a non-sections site`. GitBook keeps the last good config, so the site stops updating. |
| Never change a `key` (`section-1`, `mailroom-docs`) | GitBook reads a new key as a new node. It deletes the old node and imports a new one, with new IDs and broken links. |
| Keep `content.directory: ./docs` and space `path: /` | `content.directory` is a folder. `path` is a URL. If `path` is `docs`, the home page publishes at `…/the-digital-mailroom/docs/`. |

## How the pieces fit

Git Sync reads the site config from [`gitbook-docs.yaml`](https://github.com/Exios66/mailroom-documentation/blob/main/gitbook-docs.yaml) at the **repository root**. The repository root is also GitBook's default **Project directory**, so no hidden setting points at the config.

The site has **one space** (`mailroom-docs`). The space reads `content.directory: ./docs`, so the whole `docs/` folder is one GitBook book. `docs/README.md` is the landing page and `docs/SUMMARY.md` is the table of contents. The space is mounted at `path: /` inside the site's one section (`section-1`). Thus pages publish at `…/the-digital-mailroom/{page}`. The `docs` folder never shows as a sidebar entry.

## How it is built

| File / path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `gitbook-docs.yaml` (repository root) | The live site-wide Git Sync config, at the root of the Git Sync **project directory** (the repository root — GitBook's default). Declares the site title (**The Digital Mailroom**) and one **section** (`section-1`, `default: true`) wrapping a single space (`mailroom-docs`, `path: /`) whose `content.directory` is `./docs` — the whole `docs/` folder. A site that has a section must keep its spaces inside one; never list a space at the top level of `site.structure`. Do not change the space or section `key`. |
| `docs/.gitbook.yaml` | The `docs/` space's content config: sets the content root to `./docs` itself and names `README.md` (landing page) and `SUMMARY.md` (table of contents). |
| `docs/README.md` | The GitBook landing page. Page header is **LLM-MAILROOM** only (GitBook uses the H1 / `SUMMARY.md` title — no Fumi in the header), owl banner below the badges, two `fumi.gif`s (Postal Worker Fumi (文, "letter") on duty after the masthead, then Meet Fumi), tags, install, pipeline walk-through, and docs shelf. GitBook's own type; it does not load any static landing page's display font. GitBook strips scripts, so the idle TUI stays off the page. |
| `docs/SUMMARY.md` | The table of contents. Only pages listed here are published. |
| `docs/.gitbook/assets/` | GitBook-referenced site images (`banner.png`, `fumi.gif`, `hoot-icon.png`), referenced with relative paths such as `.gitbook/assets/banner.png`. |
| `docs/assets/` | The **single source of truth** for the site's art — the full Fumi + Hermes mascot set (`mascot/`: `fumi.svg`, `fumi.gif`, `fumi.png`, `fumi-icon.png`, `fumi-sheet.png`, `hoot-icon.png`, and `source/fumi-base.png`), the masthead `banner.png`, `fumi/fumi.gif`, and `mailroom-pipeline.svg`. See `docs/assets/README.md` and `docs/assets/mascot/README.md`. |
| Section folders under `docs/` (`start-here/`, `the-pipeline-in-depth/`, `how-it-fits-together/`, `mailroom-dataset/`, `repository-guides/`, `pipeline-reference-llm-mailroom/`, `changelog/`, `about-this-site/`) | Site content, grouped by the sections defined in `docs/SUMMARY.md`. |

All site **content** lives in the `docs/` folder:

* `docs/README.md` (landing) and `docs/SUMMARY.md` (TOC);
* `docs/.gitbook/assets/` (images and charts that pages show);
* `docs/assets/` (the Fumi + Hermes art);
* `docs/.gitbook.yaml` (the space's content config);
* the section folders.

The **repository root holds no site content**. It holds:

* the site config (`gitbook-docs.yaml`), `.gitattributes` and `.coderabbit.yaml`;
* the repository-only `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`;
* the scripts in `scripts/` (the site checker, the style report, and the chart builder);
* implementation plans (`plans/`).

There is no `landing/` or root-level `assets/` folder in this repo; the site art lives under `docs/assets/` and `docs/.gitbook/assets/`.

## Charts

Some pages show a chart next to a table. The charts are static SVG files in `docs/.gitbook/assets/`, one light and one dark (`chart-<name>-light.svg`, `chart-<name>-dark.svg`). A page shows them with a `<picture>` element, so the reader sees the file for their theme. GitBook strips scripts, so the charts have no hover. The table next to each chart holds the same values.

| Chart | Page | Data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `chart-dataset-classes` | [Mailroom dataset](../mailroom-dataset/mailroom-dataset.md) | Rows per class, v8 against v9.2 |
| `chart-extraction-routing` | [Scoring and performance](../the-pipeline-in-depth/scoring-and-metrics.md) | Extraction confidence bands per class (`taxonomy.yaml`) |

To change a charted value:

1. Change the value in the page table.
2. Change the same value in the data block of `scripts/build_charts.py`.
3. Run `python3 scripts/build_charts.py` from the repository root.
4. Look at both SVG files. Commit the page, the script and the SVG files together.

Do not hand-edit an SVG file. The palette in the script passed the colorblind and contrast checks for both themes.

## API reference

The API reference section (`docs/api-reference/`) renders GitBook OpenAPI blocks from a checked-in spec. The spec is hand-written, not generated.

1. Read the routes from `llm-mailroom` `src/api/main.py` at the `main` commit you mirror. Never check out, edit, or commit in another repository's checkout. Use `git -C <llm-mailroom checkout> show <sha>:src/api/main.py`.
2. Update `docs/api-reference/mailroom-openapi.yaml`: paths, methods, parameters, request bodies, responses, and the `info.description` ref. Keep `/v1` paths canonical. The two `/api/relations/mode` routes have no `/v1` alias.
3. Update the tag page that owns each changed operation (`health.md`, `ingest.md`, `review.md`, `documents.md`, `audit.md`, `ops.md`, `relations.md`). One page per tag. Each block repeats the spec URL inside the tag:

   ```text
   {% openapi src="<raw-github-yaml-url>" path="/v1/health" method="get" %}
   <raw-github-yaml-url>
   {% endopenapi %}
   ```

   The `src` is the `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL of the committed spec file on `main`, so GitBook fetches the version-controlled spec. Validate the YAML before you push (`python3` with `pyyaml`: `safe_load`, 16 operations, 7 tags).
4. When a route is added or removed, update the group table in `docs/api-reference/README.md`, the matching narrative in [API](../pipeline-reference-llm-mailroom/api.md), and the `operationId` list above.
5. Optional GitBook UI step: upload the same file under the space's OpenAPI specifications to enable the in-page Test-it runner against your own producer URL. The committed file stays the source of truth either way.

## Changelog

This site has a Changelog section under `docs/changelog/`. It is a generated copy of [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) in `llm-mailroom`. Do not hand-edit it. Regenerate it as follows.

1. Create a throwaway worktree of `llm-mailroom` at the `main` commit you mirror. Do not check out, edit, or commit in your own `llm-mailroom` checkout.

   ```bash
   git -C <llm-mailroom checkout> worktree add --detach <scratch>/mr-<sha> <sha>
   ```

2. Generate the pages and run the guard.

   ```bash
   cd <scratch>/mr-<sha>
   PYTHONPATH=src python3 src/scripts/sync_gitbook_changelog.py
   PYTHONPATH=src python3 src/scripts/sync_gitbook_changelog.py --check
   ```

3. Copy `README.md`, `unreleased.md`, and `2026/*.md` from the worktree `docs/changelog/` into `docs/changelog/` in this repo. Do **not** copy `SUMMARY.md`, `.gitbook.yaml`, or `.gitbook/`. Those files belong to the old nested space.
4. Apply the four site fixes. These are the only edits you make to generated pages.
   * Replace the generator hint "Regenerate with `PYTHONPATH=src python src/scripts/sync_gitbook_changelog.py`." with: `To regenerate them, follow "Changelog" in the Maintaining this site page.` The hint appears at the top of every generated page.
   * Replace the `Pipeline docs:` link to the retired *Mailroom Inc. Docs* site with `[The Digital Mailroom](https://mailroom-inc.gitbook.io/the-digital-mailroom/)`.
   * Rewrite links that resolve only inside `llm-mailroom` (`](docs/….md)`, `](docs/wiki/)`, `](README.md)`, `](AGENTS.md)`) to full `https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/blob/main/…` URLs (`tree/main/docs/wiki/` for the wiki folder). The v0.7.0 entry carries such links.
   * The generator gives the undated "Released backlog — v0.4.0 → v0.6.0 era" heading a placeholder date (`UNDATED_DATES`, `2026-08-18`). GitBook needs the date to sort the entry. Keep the `{% update date=… %}` attribute. On its page, replace "Released 2026-08-18." with "Undated catch-up entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.". In its `README.md` card, replace ", released 2026-08-18." with " (undated catch-up entry in `CHANGELOG.md`).".

   Release-entry text that mentions *Mailroom Inc. Docs* is history from `CHANGELOG.md`. Leave it.
5. When a release adds a page, add its line to the Changelog block in `docs/SUMMARY.md`. Keep the order newest first.
6. Remove the worktree: `git -C <llm-mailroom checkout> worktree remove --force <scratch>/mr-<sha>`. The generator rewrites tracked files in the worktree, so `--force` is necessary. Use it only on this throwaway worktree.

## Connecting the GitBook site (one-time)

1. In GitBook, open the site's space (the `mailroom-docs` space, titled **The Digital Mailroom**).
2. Open the space's **Configure** menu, choose **GitHub Sync**, and install the GitBook GitHub app on **`Exios66/mailroom-documentation`** (this repo — *not* `llm-mailroom`).
3. Pick the `main` branch and **leave the Project directory empty** (it defaults to the repository root, where `gitbook-docs.yaml` lives). If an earlier setup put `docs` here, clear it — the config moved to the repository root.
4. Choose **GitHub to GitBook** for the first sync so the repository content is imported rather than overwritten.

After that, a merge to `main` updates the site. Edits made in the GitBook editor come back as commits.

Mermaid diagrams render on GitHub; in GitBook they need the Mermaid integration enabled on the space, otherwise they show as code blocks.

## `path` vs `directory` (this is the usual mix-up)

The Project directory, `content.directory`, and `path` are three different knobs. Only `path` is a URL slug:

| Knob | File | Meaning | Correct value here |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Git Sync **Project directory** (GitBook UI) | — | Where GitBook looks for `gitbook-docs.yaml` | **empty** (repository root) — the config sits at `gitbook-docs.yaml` |
| `content.directory` | `gitbook-docs.yaml` | Git folder the space reads, relative to the Project directory | `./docs` (this repo's `docs/` folder) |
| `path` | `gitbook-docs.yaml` | URL after the site slug | `/` (site home) |
| space `key` | `gitbook-docs.yaml` | Stable identifier for the `mailroom-docs` space | `mailroom-docs` — **never change it** |

`content.directory` is a **folder**; `path` is a **URL**. With the config at the repository root (the default Project directory), `content.directory: ./docs` points the space at the whole `docs/` book. Do not set `path: docs`. That value publishes the home at `…/the-digital-mailroom/docs/`, not at the site root.

GitBook also replaces the markdown H1 with the `SUMMARY.md` link title. Keep that link as `* [LLM-MAILROOM](README.md)`. Then the GitBook page header reads **LLM-MAILROOM** and matches the `# LLM-MAILROOM` heading in `docs/README.md`. (The previous `* [Welcome](README.md)` title made the live home read **Welcome**.)

GitBook's published favicon is the site icon in **Customize** ([icons, colors, and themes](https://gitbook.com/docs/manage-your-site/customization/icons-colors-and-themes)). Git Sync cannot set it: `gitbook-docs.yaml` has no favicon field. Upload `docs/.gitbook/assets/hoot-icon.png` (Hermes, the pixel owl).

## Rules for editing

* **Link, do not copy.** Each repository's own README and docs stay canonical. A guide here summarizes what a newcomer needs to orient, then links to the source. This follows the llm-mailroom rule that docs content is never duplicated.
* **Every new page goes in `docs/SUMMARY.md`.** A page that is not listed is not published. Operator recipes for this site (Docker compose matrix, Modal + vLLM) live in their section folder under `docs/`. List them in `SUMMARY.md`. The upstream `deploy/README.md` is a file index, not a GitBook page. Sandbox run reports and visuals are nested under the [local-mailroom-sandbox](../repository-guides/repos/local-mailroom-sandbox/) guide. The canonical corpus has its own top-level section ([Mailroom dataset](../mailroom-dataset/mailroom-dataset.md)). Static PNGs stay on `Exios66/Mailroom-Corpus-EDA` `main` (`raw.githubusercontent.com`). The live dashboard, the Plotly charts and the Hub viewer are GitBook `embed` blocks.
* **Use relative links between pages on this site** (`pipeline-reference-llm-mailroom/architecture.md`, `../mailroom-dataset/mailroom-dataset.md`) and full GitHub URLs for anything in another repository. Every site page lives under `docs/`, so relative links stay within `docs/`.
* **Link to a heading with its GitBook id, not its GitHub id.** GitBook builds its own heading ids: `## Backup & Restore` is `#backup-and-restore`, and `## 1. Pipeline at a glance` is `#id-1.-pipeline-at-a-glance`. Copy the id from the live page. The rules are in [`AGENTS.md`](https://github.com/Exios66/mailroom-documentation/blob/main/AGENTS.md) §7.3.
* **Date facts that drift.** Versions, pins and counts carry an "as of" date; when a release moves them, update [Overview](../start-here/overview.md) and the affected guide.
* **Reference the pipeline in `llm-mailroom`. Do not relocate it.** The pipeline source (`src/`, `deploy/`, notebooks and `CHANGELOG.md`) lives in [Exios66/llm-mailroom](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom). GitHub URLs under `Exios66/llm-mailroom/...` and paths such as `pipeline-reference-llm-mailroom/...` describe the pipeline. Keep them as they are. Only the *published documentation site* is sourced from this repo.
* **Keep the GitHub wiki separate.** The `llm-mailroom` repository's own `docs/wiki/` remains wiki-only and is not mirrored on this site.

## When a repository changes

| Change | Update |
| --- | --- |
| New repository joins the constellation | Add a guide under `docs/repository-guides/repos/`, list it in `docs/SUMMARY.md`, [Overview](../start-here/overview.md), [Repository index](../how-it-fits-together/repo-index.md) and `repository-guides/repos/README.md` |
| Repository archived or superseded | Move it to the copies or earlier-monorepos table in the [Repository index](../how-it-fits-together/repo-index.md) |
| A release changes versions or pins | [Overview](../start-here/overview.md) version table, the repo's guide, the [dependency table](../how-it-fits-together/architecture.md#dependency-summary) |
| Dataset revision changes | [Mailroom dataset](../mailroom-dataset/mailroom-dataset.md) first (counts, strata, EDA figures), then [Data and corpora](../how-it-fits-together/data-and-corpora.md) |
| Pipeline nodes or classes change | The pipeline reference pages first; then [Architecture](../how-it-fits-together/architecture.md) and [Glossary](../start-here/glossary.md) if terms changed |
| Producer API routes change | `docs/api-reference/mailroom-openapi.yaml` first, then the owning tag page and [API](../pipeline-reference-llm-mailroom/api.md) (see [API reference](#api-reference)) |
| Compose matrix, Mode G, or Modal vLLM knobs change | [Docker](../pipeline-reference-llm-mailroom/deployment/docker-deployment.md) and [Modal + vLLM](../pipeline-reference-llm-mailroom/deployment/modal-vllm.md) first; keep `deploy/README.md` as an index that links those pages |
| Sandbox run reports or figures change | [Run reports](../repository-guides/repos/local-mailroom-sandbox/local-mailroom-sandbox-reports.md) and [Visuals](../repository-guides/repos/local-mailroom-sandbox/local-mailroom-sandbox-visuals.md); keep image URLs on `Exios66/local-mailroom-sandbox` `main` |
| eval-environment or mailroom-ml figures change | [eval-environment reports](../experiment-reports/eval-environment-reports.md) and [Experiment reports](../experiment-reports/experiment-reports.md); keep SVG URLs on the owning repo `main` (`eval-environment` charts live under `web/data/charts/`, not `reports/charts/`) |
| Mailroom-Corpus-EDA figures or SUMMARY\_REPORT change | [EDA reports](../mailroom-dataset/eda-reports.md) and [Visualizations](../mailroom-dataset/visualizations.md); keep PNG URLs on `Exios66/Mailroom-Corpus-EDA` `main` and iframe URLs on `exios66.github.io/Mailroom-Corpus-EDA` |
| Fumi's or Hermes's artwork changes | The full mascot set is built in the `llm-mailroom` repository (`src/scripts/build_mascot.py`, from `source/fumi-base.png`) and mirrored here under `docs/assets/mascot/` — plus `docs/assets/banner.png` and `docs/assets/fumi/fumi.gif`. Refresh the GitBook-referenced copies in `docs/.gitbook/assets/` (`banner.png`, `fumi.gif`, `hoot-icon.png`) to match. GitBook strips scripts and may not animate SVG, so the GIF is the one to use on this page. The GitBook home header is **LLM-MAILROOM** only; Fumi appears twice as `fumi.gif` after the masthead (Postal Worker Fumi (文, "letter") on duty, then Meet Fumi). The owl banner, title, and badges stay the masthead. Re-upload `hoot-icon.png` in GitBook Customize if the Hermes sprite changes. |
| `llm-mailroom` `CHANGELOG.md` changes | Regenerate the Changelog section (see [Changelog](#changelog)). Update a quoted version on another page only if that page states it. |
