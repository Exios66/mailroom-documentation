# Repository index

This page lists every repository connected to the Mailroom, including copies and earlier attempts. For each repository, it tells you where to make a change.

## Where to make a change

1. Find the repository in [Active repositories](#active-repositories).
2. If the **Develop in** column names a monorepo package, make the change in `LLM-Mailroom-Services/Digital-Mailroom` under that package. Then release with `scripts/sync_packages.py push`. Do not edit the `Exios66/*` repository by hand.
3. If the **Develop in** column says "here", make the change in that repository directly.
4. If the repository is in [Organization copies and forks](#organization-copies-and-forks) or [Earlier monorepos](#earlier-monorepos-and-derived-sites), do not start work there. Find the active repository that it copies.

**Why the monorepo.** A change that touches two packages (for example, a new span name in llm-mailroom and in The-Mailroom) must land in one commit. The monorepo makes that possible. The `Exios66/*` repositories are release vehicles that deploy targets install from. See [The constellation](architecture.md#code-monorepo-and-release-repos).

Status snapshot: 2026-10-06. "Mirror" and "earlier monorepo" labels below are inferred from each repository's README and commit history; confirm with the owner before archiving anything.

## Organization copies and forks

These live under the `LLM-Mailroom-Services` organization and track an `Exios66/*` repository or the monorepo. Do not start new work in them unless the owner says otherwise.
