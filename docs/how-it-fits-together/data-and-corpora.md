# Data and corpora

Every evaluation, training run and pilot in the constellation draws from one dataset family on Hugging Face, published under the [`Lucius-Morningstar`](https://huggingface.co/Lucius-Morningstar) organization. This page is the constellation-wide rules summary.

The full GitBook breakdown — 55 strata, configs, source cards, EDA reports, and all 30 figures — lives in [**Mailroom dataset**](../mailroom-dataset/mailroom-dataset.md). Live dashboard, Hub Dataset Viewer, and Plotly charts are on [Visualizations](../mailroom-dataset/visualizations.md).

## The canonical dataset

[`Lucius-Morningstar/mailroom-dataset`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Lucius-Morningstar/mailroom-dataset) is the corpus every repository measures against. It is called "v1" on the Hub and "v9" in the corpus family's lineage; both names refer to the same thing.

| Fact                     | Value                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Documents                | 3,302 (2,979 train, 323 test)                                                                                               |
| Document classes         | 5                                                                                                                           |
| Class-by-subclass strata | 55                                                                                                                          |
| Pinned revision          | `670e8bc6` (tag v9.2)                                                                                                       |
| Frozen parent            | [`mailroom-corpus`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Lucius-Morningstar/mailroom-corpus) v8, 2,000 rows, revision `eafe1ab4` |

The published pin is `v9.2`. As of 2026-10-07, `llm-mailroom` 0.8.0 and the sandbox still read the predecessor tag `v9.1` (commit `bc9eab28`, data commit `ed7576b6`), so results from those two should name the pin they used. See [Mailroom dataset](../mailroom-dataset/mailroom-dataset.md).

| ------------------ | ----: | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `insurance_claim`  | 1,100 | CMS DE-SynPUF, GNOTHEIA, BDR, INSURBIAS narratives | Apache-2.0 / MIT / CC BY 4.0                             |
| `correspondence`   | 1,000 | Enron de-duplicated corpus                         | research use; contains real names, handle conservatively |
| `contract`         |   600 | CUAD v1 (509) + SEC EDGAR EX-10 (91)               | CC BY 4.0 / US public domain                             |
| `corporate_record` |   450 | SEC EDGAR S-1 and 8-K exhibits                     | US public domain                                         |

### Configs

| Config         |  Rows | Contents                                                                           |
| -------------- | ----: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default`      | 3,302 | Document text and metadata only. No labels, by construction.                       |
| `ground_truth` | 3,302 | Labels (`gt_fields`), hashes, the evaluation contract, matter and group membership |
| `bundles`      |    50 | Synthetic multi-document bundles built over real anchors                           |
| `streams`      |    62 | An interleaved ingress stream with distractors                                     |
| `fixtures`     |    32 | Recovery and adversarial fixtures used for calibration                             |

To use it, load `default` and `ground_truth` separately and join on `filename`:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
blind = load_dataset("Lucius-Morningstar/mailroom-dataset", "default")
gt = load_dataset("Lucius-Morningstar/mailroom-dataset", "ground_truth")
```

The pipeline itself does not depend on the `datasets` library; it loads the corpus through `pipeline/hf_corpus_loader.py`, which also verifies each row's `content_sha256` against its text.

## Rules everyone follows

* **Pin a revision.** Never read the live tip of a dataset. Code records the revision it used so results are reproducible.
* **Keep labels blind.** The model under test only ever sees the `default` config. Labels live in a separate config precisely so that a missed filter cannot hand the answers to the model.
* **One split rule.** Across the whole family, `md5(filename) % 10 == 0` means test, so a document is in the same split in every dataset that contains it. Because the split is a pure function of the filename, no repository needs to store or share a split file. A training builder must still apply the rule to exclude test rows.
* **Subclasses are strata, not classes.** `expected_subclass` is a second-level label (for example `all_cash` under `merger_agreement`). It is not promoted to a top-level class unless the pipeline's taxonomy adopts it.
* **Retired classes stay retired.** `compliance_filing`, `court_opinion` and `due_diligence` are no longer live classes.

The dataset cards (one per source) live in Mailroom-Corpus-EDA under [`docs/dataset-cards/`](https://github.com/Exios66/Mailroom-Corpus-EDA/tree/main/docs/dataset-cards), and `run_all.py` there reproduces every number on this page. GitBook copies of those cards, plus the EDA figures, are in [Mailroom dataset](../mailroom-dataset/mailroom-dataset.md).

## Sources

Every figure on this page is reproduced by `run_all.py` in Mailroom-Corpus-EDA against Hub tag `v9.2` / `670e8bc6`, and is cross-checked against the canonical write-up:
