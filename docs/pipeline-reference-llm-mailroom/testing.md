# Testing

The unit suite runs with **no network and no API key**. A shared fixture replaces every LLM client with a mock. Thus a green suite proves that the routing, the schemas, the file moves and the audit chain are correct. A green suite does **not** prove that a model classifies or extracts well. To measure model quality, run a pilot with real calls.

| If you want to... | Run | Network |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Check a code change before you push | `pytest -q` | None |
| Test one area (routing, audit, an agent) | `pytest src/tests/<file>.py -v` | None |
| Run the full graph on the 25 sample documents with fake LLM answers | `PYTHONPATH=src python src/scripts/run_pilot.py --mock` | None |
| Measure real model accuracy | `PYTHONPATH=src python src/scripts/run_pilot.py --real` | LLM provider; costs money |
| Compare two pilot runs | Add `--baseline <earlier report>.json` to `run_pilot.py` | As the run |
| Evaluate one agent outside the graph | `PYTHONPATH=src python src/scripts/run_agent_eval.py` | LLM provider |
| Run only the tests a change can affect | `PYTHONPATH=src python src/scripts/affected_tests.py --run -- -q` (default base `origin/main`) | None |
| Gate a change against a saved regression gate (unreleased on `main`, as of 2026-10-08) | `PYTHONPATH=src python src/scripts/run_experiment.py --dataset mailroom-fixtures --mock` with `--baseline` | None. See [Langfuse](deployment/langfuse.md#experiment-regression-gate) |

The test environment is hermetic. The autouse fixture `_set_test_env` in `conftest.py` sets `OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER=none`, sets `MAILROOM_GMAIL_ENABLED=0` and `MAILROOM_DOCCLASS_PROMPTS=0`, and stops a late reload of `.env`. A key in your local `.env` does not change a test result.

## Test Categories

### Agent Unit Tests (`test_agents/`)

**44 test functions across 4 files** (`test_base.py` 12, `test_sorter.py` 14, `test_specialists.py` 16, `test_prompt_calibration.py` 2), covering:

* Sorter: classification across all doc types, low-confidence cases, JSON parse errors, output validation
* Contracts Specialist: extraction accuracy, confidence scoring
* Corporate Records Specialist: entity/record extraction
* Correspondence Specialist: action item extraction
* Merger Agreement Specialist: MAUD consideration, parties, clauses
* Insurance Claims Specialist: claim extraction, parse-error lane
* Boss Agent: adjudication decisions, system metrics analysis

All LLM calls are **mocked** — tests assert schema conformance and confidence-path branching without real API calls.

### Routing Tests (`test_routing.py`)

**38 tests** covering every conditional edge:

* High confidence → extract
* Medium band → one retry → Lane A reviewer → extract or human review
* Low confidence → retry (up to `retry_max`) → human review
* Transient provider errors → retry on their own counter, not the confidence budget
* Conflict detection → Boss escalation
* Boss decision → compile\_report or human review
* Human review → approved or failed

### Audit Log Tests (`test_audit_log.py`)

**14 tests** covering:

* Hash computation and chaining
* Chain verification (valid chains)
* Tamper detection (modified hash)
* Broken link detection (wrong prev\_hash)
* Empty chain handling
* Deterministic hashing

### E2E Pipeline Tests (`test_pipeline_e2e.py`)

**6 tests** covering full pipeline runs:

* Happy path: contract document → archived
* Low confidence path: ambiguous document → review
* Medium confidence path: route to human review
* Ingest node: manifest creation and file reading
* Full pipeline with mocked LLM: correspondence → archived
* Ingest: real PDF bytes transcription

These tests spin up a complete LangGraph graph with all 13 nodes and mock the LLM layer, verifying:

* State flows through all nodes correctly
* Files move between bins
* Archive paths are correct
* Manifests are created

## Test Fixtures

### Pilot sample set

The pilot sample set is for live end-to-end pilots, not for the unit suite. It is in `docs/examples/samples/` of `llm-mailroom`, with a ground-truth `manifest.csv`.

* **Content.** The live manifest lists 25 documents. 15 are real legal documents: CC-BY-4.0 CUAD/Atticus contracts and LegalBench MAUD merger agreements. The others are synthetic `.txt` samples written in the repository, including three `insurance_claim` coverage letters.
* **Build.** `src/scripts/prepare_samples.py` builds the set. `src/scripts/fetch_external_samples.py` gets the external corpus.
* **Run.** `src/scripts/run_pilot.py` evaluates the set:
  * `--mock` runs all 25 samples with fake LLM answers. The result is deterministic.
  * `--real` measures real LLM accuracy on the 15 real documents only. It refuses the synthetic samples, because their only purpose is to test the pipeline machinery.
  * `--baseline <report>.json` compares this run with an earlier run.
  * `--source <corpus>` runs one dataset only.
* **One agent.** `src/scripts/run_agent_eval.py` evaluates one agent without the full graph.

See `docs/examples/samples/README.md` in `llm-mailroom`.

| `due_diligence/sample_checklist.txt`          | Due Diligence    | Simple DD checklist — tests sparse data *(retired class — kept on disk)* |

Fixtures are grouped **one directory per document class**. There is deliberately **no `compliance_filing/` directory**: the compliance arm (module, schema, prompts, and its eval fixtures) was removed on 2026-09-15 — see [Agents](agents.md). `court_opinion` and `due_diligence` are retired classes whose fixtures are **retained on disk** so their historical suites still run.

## Writing New Tests

### Agent Unit Test Pattern

```python
class TestNewAgent:
    def test_extract(self, sample_text, mock_openai_client):
        # Set the mock response
        mock_openai_client.chat.completions.create.return_value \
            .choices[0].message.content = '{"field": "value", "confidence": 0.95}'

        # Import and instantiate
        from agents.new_specialist import NewSpecialist
        agent = NewSpecialist()
        agent.client = mock_openai_client
        agent.model = "test-model"

        # Call and assert
        result = agent.extract(sample_text[:1000])
        assert result.get("confidence", 0) >= 0.80
        assert "value" in result.get("field", "")
```

### Routing Test Pattern

```python
from graph.routing import after_classify

def test_routing_scenario():
    state = {
        "classification_confidence": 0.50,
        "classification_attempts": 1,
        "doc_type": "contract",
    }
    assert after_classify(state) == "retry_classify"
```

### E2E Test Pattern

```python
def test_full_pipeline(self, temp_base_dir, mock_openai_client):
    from graph.build_graph import build_graph

    # Create test file (temp_base_dir already set MAILROOM_BASE_DIR)
    from pipeline.bins import inbox_dir
    test_file = inbox_dir() / "test.txt"
    test_file.write_text("Document content...")

    # Build graph and run
    graph = build_graph()
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "test-1"}}
    result = graph.invoke(initial_state, config)

    # Assert final state
    assert result["stage"] == "archived"
```

***

## Test Configuration

In `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
asyncio_mode = "auto"
testpaths = ["src/tests"]
pythonpath = ["src", "."]
```

`asyncio_mode = "auto"` runs every `async def` test without a `@pytest.mark.asyncio` marker. The graph nodes are synchronous, so most tests are plain `def` functions.
