# Llamafiles

A [llamafile](https://docs.mozilla.ai/llamafile) is an LLM server in one executable file, from Mozilla. The file runs on **linux amd64 and aarch64** and serves an OpenAI-compatible `/v1` API. Mode A uses a llamafile as a sidecar container for a fully offline LLM. It needs no API key, makes no network calls and costs nothing per document.

**Llamafile or Ollama?** Both serve Mode A.

* **Use a llamafile** when you want one pinned binary and one GGUF file, with no model registry. All agents share the one model.
* **Use Ollama** when you want to pull several models by tag and let Ollama unload idle models.

The full comparison is on [Local models](../local-models.md).

Three upstream files control the sidecar:

* [`deploy/llamafile/Dockerfile`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/blob/main/deploy/llamafile/Dockerfile) — the sidecar image
* [`deploy/llamafile/entrypoint.sh`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/blob/main/deploy/llamafile/entrypoint.sh) — server flags
* [`deploy/docker-compose.llamafile.yml`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/blob/main/deploy/docker-compose.llamafile.yml) — the overlay that wires it to `app`

## The image

Base is `debian:bookworm-slim`. The binary is downloaded at build time and **pinned**:

```dockerfile
ARG LLAMAFILE_VERSION=0.10.4    # pin a tested release (bump deliberately)
RUN curl -fsSL -o llamafile \
      "https://github.com/mozilla-ai/llamafile/releases/download/${LLAMAFILE_VERSION}/llamafile-${LLAMAFILE_VERSION}" \
    && chmod +x llamafile
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**GGUF weights are never baked into the image.** They are multi-GB and bind-mounted read-only from the host at runtime (`./models:/models:ro`). `.dockerignore` excludes `*.gguf` and `deploy/models/` from every build context — if you find yourself trying to `COPY` a model in, stop and read [Stage the weights](#stage-the-weights) instead.
{% endhint %}

## Server flags

The entrypoint turns environment variables into llamafile arguments:

```sh
exec /llamafile/llamafile \
  --server \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8080 \
  -m "$LLAMAFILE_MODEL" \
  -a "${LLAMAFILE_ALIAS:-qwen3:7b}" \
  --jinja \
  --ctx-size "${LLAMAFILE_CTX:-16384}" \
  --no-webui \
  --mlock \
  -np 1 \
  --gpu "${LLAMAFILE_GPU:-disable}"
```

Four of those flags are load-bearing, per the upstream comments:

* `--server` is **required**. From llamafile 0.10.x the default mode is a combined server *and* chat UI, which is not what the pipeline's OpenAI client expects.
* `--jinja` enables the chat template, which agentic OpenAI-compatible clients need to get a usable system/user split.
* `--mlock` keeps the model RAM-resident.
* `-np 1` runs a **single server slot**, because the pipeline processes one document at a time in serial.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| `LLAMAFILE_MODEL` | `/models/llamafile/qwen3-7b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf` | **Required.** Path to the GGUF *inside* the container |
| `LLAMAFILE_ALIAS` | `qwen3:7b` | Served model id on `/v1/models` |
| `LLAMAFILE_CTX` | `16384` | Context size in tokens — the KV-cache budget versus available RAM |
| `LLAMAFILE_GPU` | `disable` | `auto` \| `nvidia` \| `amd` \| `apple` \| `vulkan` \| `disable` |

{% hint style="warning" %}
`LLAMAFILE_ALIAS` **must match** a value in `src/config/taxonomy.yaml` under `llamafile_model_map:`. That is the id the pipeline requests; a mismatch produces a model-not-found error even though the sidecar is healthy.
{% endhint %}

`LLAMAFILE_GPU` defaults to `disable`, so the sidecar is CPU-only until you opt in — on a machine with a supported accelerator set it to `auto` or the specific backend.

## Stage the weights

Weights live on the host under `deploy/models/llamafile/`, never in git (see [`deploy/models/README.md`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/blob/main/deploy/models/README.md)):

```
deploy/models/
└── llamafile/
    └── qwen3-7b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf   # ~4.7 GB (Q4_K_M); drop yours here
```

1. Download any GGUF you like into `deploy/models/llamafile/`.
2. The compose mount makes it available at `/models/llamafile/<file>` read-only.
3. Point `LLAMAFILE_MODEL` at the **in-container** path, not the host path.

The alternative, if you would rather not reference the host checkout, is to pre-seed a named volume once with `docker compose cp`.

## Run it

```bash
docker compose --profile local-llm \
  -f deploy/docker-compose.yml \
  -f deploy/docker-compose.llamafile.yml \
  --env-file .env up -d --build
```

The overlay sets, on `app`:

```yaml
DEFAULT_PROVIDER: llamafile
LLAMAFILE_BASE_URL: http://llamafile:8080/v1
MAILROOM_BERT_INTAKE: "1"
OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER: "${MAILROOM_OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER:-none}"
```

Note that tracing defaults to **off** in this overlay. A CPU-only offline LLM is usually a debugging or air-gapped posture, so the compose author left observability opt-in; set `OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER` (or `MAILROOM_OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER`) if you want traces.

{% hint style="info" %}
**The port is not published.** `app` reaches the sidecar over the compose network at `http://llamafile:8080/v1`. Add a `ports:` mapping only when you need host-side debugging — the served model has no authentication.
{% endhint %}

Service details: profile `local-llm` (shared with `src/config/docker`), container `mailroom-llamafile`, `restart: unless-stopped`, healthcheck `curl -fs http://127.0.0.1:8080/health`, and `start_period: 30s` to allow for model load at server start. `app` waits on `llamafile` being healthy.

`LLAMAFILE_VERSION` is also passable as a compose build arg (`${LLAMAFILE_VERSION:-0.10.4}`) if you need to bump the binary without editing the Dockerfile.

## Ollama instead

Mode A also has an [Ollama](docker-deployment.md#mode-a--ollama-offline) path (`deploy/docker-compose.ollama.yml`, `DEFAULT_PROVIDER=ollama`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://ollama:11434/v1`). Both share the `local-llm` profile name, so they can be combined or swapped without renaming. Choosing between local runtimes is covered in [Local models](../local-models.md).
