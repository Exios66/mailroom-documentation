# Langfuse

Langfuse is the pipeline's **default tracing backend**. It is the first backend in the `auto` resolution chain. It is also the only backend that records one span for each graph node, not only the LLM calls. Tracing is optional: the pipeline runs identically with tracing off.

| If you want to... | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| See one trace per document, with a span for each node | Use Langfuse (Cloud or self-hosted) |
| Trace LLM calls locally at no cost | Use [Apache Phoenix](phoenix.md) |
| Run with no tracing | Set `OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER=none` |
| Keep traces on your own hardware | Use [Self-hosted Langfuse](#self-hosted-langfuse) |

The active backend is chosen by `OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER`, resolved in [`src/observability/tracing.py`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/blob/main/src/observability/tracing.py):

| `OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER` | Behaviour |
| ------------------------- | --------- |
| `auto` *(default)* | Langfuse if `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` is set → Braintrust if `BRAINTRUST_API_KEY` is set → local [Phoenix](phoenix.md) if enabled → `none` |
| `langfuse` | Force Langfuse |
| `braintrust` | Force Braintrust |
| `phoenix` | Force [Phoenix](phoenix.md) |
| `none` | Disable tracing entirely |

## What Langfuse captures

Two layers, both in [`src/observability/langfuse_setup.py`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/blob/main/src/observability/langfuse_setup.py):

1. **LLM calls.** `get_llm()` in `llm/client.py` passes the OpenAI client through `observability.tracing.instrument_openai_client`, which imports `langfuse.openai` and calls `register_tracing`. That monkeypatches `Completions.create`, so **every chat completion** becomes a `generation` observation carrying model, tokens, cost and latency.
2. **Pipeline structure.** `pipeline_trace()` opens one root **chain** per document — one trace is one unit of work — with `session_id = matter_id` and a deterministic trace id seeded from the file name, so re-running the same file reuses its trace. `observation()` opens typed children (agent / evaluator / retriever / span / generation) with verb-first stable names. Generations created inside a node's observation nest under it automatically.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Structured per-node spans are Langfuse-only.** The Phoenix and Braintrust backends trace LLM calls but **not** `pipeline_trace` / `observation` node spans — those helpers no-op. If you want one trace per document with a visible span for each of the 13 graph nodes, Langfuse is the only backend that provides it. See [Apache Phoenix](phoenix.md) for the exact split.
{% endhint %}

## Configuration

```bash
# Required
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...

# Cloud (default region)
LANGFUSE_HOST=https://us.cloud.langfuse.com
# Self-hosted
# LANGFUSE_HOST=http://localhost:3000
# LANGFUSE_BASE_URL is accepted as an alias for cloud-hosted setups
```

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| `LANGFUSE_HOST` | `http://localhost:3000` | Base URL. `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` is an alias |
| `LANGFUSE_FLUSH_AT` | `512` | SDK batch size (event count) |
| `LANGFUSE_FLUSH_INTERVAL` | `5` s | SDK batch interval |
| `LANGFUSE_RELEASE` | — | Optional release/version label on every observation |
| `OBSERVABILITY_ENVIRONMENT` | — | Environment label; `LANGFUSE_TRACING_ENVIRONMENT` also accepted |

`_resolve_host()` reads `LANGFUSE_HOST`, then `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL`, then falls back to `http://localhost:3000`.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Call `flush()` before a short-lived job exits.** The SDK sends spans in batches from a background exporter. If a one-shot script or CI job exits first, the SDK drops the unsent spans. Pipeline processes run long enough to send their spans. Ad-hoc scripts and eval batches need an explicit flush.
{% endhint %}

## Self-hosted Langfuse

The self-hosted stack gives Langfuse **its own** Postgres server and a ClickHouse server. See [Postgres](postgres.md) for how that Postgres differs from the pipeline catalog. All three services come from [`src/config/docker/docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/blob/main/src/config/docker/docker-compose.yml):

| Service | Image | Port | Purpose |
| ------- | ----- | ---- | ------- |
| `langfuse-server` | `langfuse/langfuse:2.93.0` | 3000 | Trace viewer UI |
| `postgres` | `pgvector/pgvector:pg16` | 5432 | Langfuse's relational store |
| `clickhouse` | `clickhouse/clickhouse-server:24.8-alpine` | 8123, 9000 | Langfuse's analytics store |

```bash
# From a repo checkout
docker compose -f src/config/docker/docker-compose.yml \
  up -d postgres clickhouse langfuse-server
```

The stack does not start until `.env` sets:

```bash
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=...      # compose fails fast if unset
SALT=...                 # compose fails fast if unset
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=...
CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=...
```

Startup is healthcheck-gated: `langfuse-server` waits on `postgres` **and** `clickhouse` being healthy. Its healthcheck is `wget -qO- http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin`. `LANGFUSE_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES` is set to `"true"`.

**First run:**

1. Open `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Create an account and a project.
3. Generate API keys for the project.
4. Put the keys in `.env` as `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`.
5. Set `LANGFUSE_HOST=http://localhost:3000`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use `src/config/docker/docker-compose.yml`, not the Mode G stack. The Mode G [`deploy/docker-compose.full.yml`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/blob/main/deploy/docker-compose.full.yml) does **not** run Langfuse — it wires `LANGFUSE_*` keys for Langfuse **Cloud**, and offers local [Phoenix](phoenix.md) behind a compose profile instead.

## Trace privacy, prompt cache and score configs

*Unreleased on llm-mailroom `main` (after v0.8.0, as of 2026-10-08). The `langfuse>=4.9,<5` floor applies from the same change.*

* **E-mail masking.** [`observability/masking.py`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/blob/main/src/observability/masking.py) registers `mask_otel_spans`. It replaces every e-mail address in an exported span with `[email]`.
* **Body redaction.** Set `MAILROOM_TRACE_REDACT=1` to drop generation prompt and completion bodies as well. The default is `0`. The `pipeline-result` generation is the judge target, so neither layer touches it.
* **Prompt cache.** Managed prompts stay in the cache for `MAILROOM_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL` seconds (default `60`). A failed fetch is never cached. A miss is retried after 30 seconds.
* **Score configs.** Score emission now attaches the Langfuse score-config id by default.
* **Gmail triage trace.** The trace carries the `mailroom` tag and the environment tag. Its input holds file metadata only. The allowlisted `intake_meta` keeps the source, the route and a hashed message id, and never the sender or the subject. The pipeline flushes the trace in a `finally` block.

## Experiment regression gate

*Unreleased on llm-mailroom `main` (after v0.8.0, as of 2026-10-08).*

[`src/scripts/run_experiment.py`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/blob/main/src/scripts/run_experiment.py) pushes each dataset item through the pipeline, scores the items, and compares the totals with an approved baseline.

```bash
# Hermetic gate: no API key, no Langfuse
PYTHONPATH=src python src/scripts/run_experiment.py --dataset mailroom-fixtures --mock \
  --baseline docs/superpowers/baselines/experiment-baseline.json
# Approve a new baseline
PYTHONPATH=src python src/scripts/run_experiment.py --dataset mailroom-fixtures --mock \
  --write-baseline docs/superpowers/baselines/experiment-baseline.json
```

| Flag | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| `--dataset` | Required. `mailroom-fixtures` is hermetic. `mailroom-pilot` needs the sample documents from the monorepo |
| `--mock` / `--real` | Fake LLM, or a real LLM (needs `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) |
| `--baseline` / `--write-baseline` | Gate against a baseline file, or write one |
| `--tolerance` | Allowed drop per metric (default `0.02`) |
| `--max-items` | Limit the run |
| `--langfuse` | Use the hosted SDK experiment runner, so the run appears under Experiments. Needs `LANGFUSE_*` |

The gate **fails closed**. An empty dataset, a task error or a missing metric never passes. The approved baseline covers 9 fixture items, with `class_accuracy`, `macro_class_accuracy` and `macro_f1` all at `1.0`. [`experiments/mailroom_gate.py`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/blob/main/experiments/mailroom_gate.py) is the `experiment(context)` entry point for `langfuse/experiment-action`. The repository ships no CI workflow for it.

`sync_dataset.py --source hf` builds the Langfuse dataset from the Hugging Face mailroom corpus at its pinned revision. Add `--hf-live` to load the pinned Hub revision.

## Scores in Langfuse

Trace wiring pushes results as well as calls: [`langfuse_field_scoring.py`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/blob/main/src/observability/langfuse_field_scoring.py) and [`scores.py`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/blob/main/src/observability/scores.py) write per-field and per-document scores onto the active trace. Definitions live in [Scoring and performance](../../the-pipeline-in-depth/scoring-and-metrics.md).

## Pulling traces offline

[`src/scripts/sync_langfuse_logs.py`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/blob/main/src/scripts/sync_langfuse_logs.py) exports traces to `data/langfuse_logs/` for analysis without the UI:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python src/scripts/sync_langfuse_logs.py --since 24h
```

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- | ------- |
| `--since` | `24h` | Lookback window |
| `--limit` | `100` | Maximum traces |
| `--trace-id` | — | Single trace |
| `--output` | `data/langfuse_logs` | Destination directory |
| `--wait-scores` | — | Block until async scores land |
