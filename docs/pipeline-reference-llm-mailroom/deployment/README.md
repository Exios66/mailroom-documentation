# Deployment

This page covers the laptop install, production process management, the producer for The-Mailroom, Railway, Hugging Face Spaces, backup and restore, and log handling.

## Choose a deployment

| Your goal | Use | Page |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Try the pipeline on one machine | Laptop install (Python + SQLite) | This page, steps 1 to 6 |
| Run the pipeline with no cloud LLM | Docker with Ollama or llamafiles | [Docker deployment](docker-deployment.md), [Llamafiles](llamafiles.md) |
| Give The-Mailroom a live producer | Producer container, Railway, or a Hugging Face Space | This page, [Docker Deployment (producer)](#docker-deployment-producer-for-the-mailroom) and [Railway](#railway) |
| Use open-weight models on a remote GPU | Modal + vLLM, usually behind the LiteLLM gateway | [Modal + vLLM](modal-vllm.md), [LiteLLM gateway](litellm-gateway.md) |
| Keep traces in-house | Self-hosted Langfuse or local Phoenix | [Langfuse](langfuse.md), [Apache Phoenix](phoenix.md) |
| Run many workers or a large volume | Postgres instead of SQLite | [Postgres](postgres.md) |

Each choice changes one layer and keeps the other layers the same. The model provider, the database and the trace backend are independent settings, so you can combine them.

The **full Docker compose matrix** (Modes B / Mixed / A-ollama / A-llamafile / M / G) is [Docker deployment](docker-deployment.md). Remote GPU OpenAI `/v1` is [Modal + vLLM](modal-vllm.md). Compose files themselves live in [`deploy/`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/tree/main/deploy/README.md).

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11+
* OpenRouter API key (or a local LLM)
* Docker (optional — only needed for Langfuse tracing and/or local LLMs)
* 8GB+ RAM (16GB+ recommended for local model inference)

***

## 1. Clone and Configure

```bash
git clone <repo-url> llm-mailroom
cd llm-mailroom
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your values:

```bash
# Required for OpenRouter (primary provider)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key-here

# Database — SQLite by default (no server needed).
# The file is created automatically at {MAILROOM_BASE_DIR}/mailroom.db.
# To use Postgres instead, uncomment:
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://mailroom:mailroom@localhost:5432/mailroom

# Observability (optional) — Langfuse cloud, Langfuse self-hosted, Braintrust,
# or the local cost-free Arize Phoenix backend.
# OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER=auto picks Langfuse when a secret key is set, else
# Braintrust when its key is set, else the local Phoenix backend (no cloud, no
# tokens — the default fallback).
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
# Cloud: LANGFUSE_HOST=https://us.cloud.langfuse.com
# Self-hosted: LANGFUSE_HOST=http://localhost:3000 (LANGFUSE_BASE_URL is an alias)
# Alternative backends:
#   OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER=braintrust + BRAINTRUST_API_KEY
#   OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER=phoenix  (local; PHOENIX_ENDPOINT, run `phoenix serve`)

# Pipeline
MAILROOM_BASE_DIR=./data
```

***

## 2. Install Application

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

***

## 3. Database

**Nothing to do** — SQLite tables are auto-created on first use. You'll see `data/mailroom.db` (catalog + audit log) appear after the first document is processed. `data/checkpoints.db` (LangGraph crash-resume state) is **opt-in**: set `MAILROOM_CHECKPOINTER=sqlite` to use the on-disk SqliteSaver; the default checkpointer is in-memory (MemorySaver), so no checkpoint file is written.

If you opted for Postgres, start it and initialize:

```bash
docker compose -f src/config/docker/docker-compose.yml up -d postgres
python -c "import asyncio; from storage.db import init_db; asyncio.run(init_db())"
```

***

## 4. Run Services

Start the services. Use one terminal for each service, or use a process manager.

```bash
# Terminal 1: API (embeds the inbox watcher by default)
PYTHONPATH=src python -m api.main

# Terminal 2 (optional): dedicated watcher — only if MAILROOM_EMBED_WATCHER=0
PYTHONPATH=src python -m pipeline.watcher

# Terminal 3 (optional): Ops Monitor (system health sweeps)
PYTHONPATH=src python -m pipeline.ops_monitor
```

Uploads land in the inbox and drain while a watcher is running. `python -m api.main` starts that watcher in-process unless `MAILROOM_EMBED_WATCHER=0` (use that when a dedicated `python -m pipeline.watcher` already holds `watcher.lock`). `GET /health` reports `checks.watcher` (`live` / `stale` / `missing`) and `inbox_pending` so The-Mailroom's live floor can show operator liveness without fabricating document rows.

***

## 5. Verify Pipeline

```bash
# Upload a test document (returns upload_id; the watcher mints the doc_id
# once processing starts — see it in /queue or the watcher logs)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/upload \
  -F "file=@src/tests/fixtures/contract/sample_msa.txt" \
  -F "matter_id=TEST-001"

# Check status (use the doc_id once processing has started)
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/status/<doc_id>

# View the queue (uploaded/processing/recent docs, incl. upload_id tracking)
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/queue

# View audit trail
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/audit/<doc_id>

# Check pipeline health
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/ops/status
```

`/v1` is the current interface; the same routes are also served without the prefix, but those aliases are deprecated. See the [API reference](../api.md).

***

## 6. Verify Observability (optional)

**Langfuse cloud:** open your project dashboard at `us.cloud.langfuse.com` and confirm traces appear as documents flow through the pipeline.

**Langfuse self-hosted:** open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. Set up your first user account, generate API keys, and put them in `.env` (`LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`/`LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`/`LANGFUSE_HOST`).

**Braintrust:** set `OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER=braintrust` + `BRAINTRUST_API_KEY` and check your Braintrust project's logs.

**Arize Phoenix (local, cost-free):** start it with `phoenix serve` (or `python -m phoenix.server.main serve`), then open `http://localhost:6006` and confirm traces appear as documents flow. This is the default fallback in `auto` mode — no cloud subscription, no quota, nothing spent on top of the LLM API calls. The Phoenix SQLite DB can be deleted when a batch is done (pour-in, poke-around, discard).

Every LLM call (classification, extraction, reports, Boss) is auto-traced; no per-node wiring is needed.

***

## Production Considerations

### Process Management

Use `systemd`, `supervisord`, or Docker to manage the processes. The API includes the watcher by default, so the minimum is two processes:

```
[Service] mailroom-api      → PYTHONPATH=src uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
[Service] ops-monitor       → PYTHONPATH=src python -m pipeline.ops_monitor
```

If you want the watcher in its own process (for example, to restart it without the API), set `MAILROOM_EMBED_WATCHER=0` on the API and add a third service:

```
[Service] pipeline-watcher  → PYTHONPATH=src python -m pipeline.watcher
```

Do not run an embedded watcher and a dedicated watcher together. Only one watcher can hold `watcher.lock`.

### Database

* **Default:** a local SQLite file (`data/mailroom.db`). Back it up along with `data/checkpoints.db` (present only when `MAILROOM_CHECKPOINTER=sqlite` is on) and `/archive`.
* The audit log is append-only — size will grow over time.
* For higher volume or multi-process setups, switch to Postgres via `DATABASE_URL` and consider partitioning `audit_log` by date for long-term retention.

### Security

* Encrypt `/archive` at rest and the SQLite files at rest (filesystem encryption, cloud KMS, etc.)
* Access-control the FastAPI endpoints (API keys, OAuth, or network-level)
* Access-control the Langfuse UI (it exposes full document content in traces)
* Do not expose Postgres or ClickHouse ports publicly (if you run them for Langfuse)
* Back up `/archive` and the audit log table independently

### Scaling

For pilot scale (dozens of documents/day):

* The current architecture (threaded watcher, single process) is sufficient
* SQLite handles the concurrency comfortably at this scale

For higher volumes:

* Consider Redis-based queuing (deferred per the roadmap)
* Multiple watcher workers with distinct worker IDs (claim mechanism already handles this)
* Load-balance the API behind a reverse proxy

### Monitoring

* Langfuse: live trace viewer for LLM call latency, token usage, error rates
* `/ops/status`: pipeline-level metrics (stuck docs, review backlog, error rates)
* Ops monitor: automated periodic sweeps with Boss agent analysis
* Standard infrastructure monitoring for Postgres, ClickHouse, disk usage on `/archive`

## Docker Deployment (producer for The-Mailroom)

The compose matrix (OpenRouter, Ollama, llamafile, Mode G LiteLLM + Modal GPU tiers, BERT build args) is documented in [Docker deployment](docker-deployment.md). This section is only the **reachable producer** The-Mailroom pairs with.

The-Mailroom Observatory ([PR #30](https://github.com/Exios66/The-Mailroom/pull/30)) needs a **reachable** llm-mailroom producer for the floor lamp, Inbox **Queue a document** (`POST /v1/upload`), and REVIEW resolve (`MAILROOM_PIPELINE_URL` + `MAILROOM_PIPELINE_TOKEN` + `MAILROOM_PIPELINE_API_PREFIX=/v1`). The visualizer proxies operator clicks here; the browser never holds the token. Two Hub Spaces — this producer and The-Mailroom `mailroom-observatory` — are documented in [`deploy/space/PAIRING.md`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/tree/main/deploy/space/PAIRING.md).

### Local (laptop pair)

Set `MAILROOM_API_TOKEN` in `.env`, then:

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.producer.yml --env-file .env up -d --build
```

The producer image is a multi-stage build that runs as non-root (`mailroom`, uid 10001), ships a `HEALTHCHECK` against `/health`, and the compose file sets `security_opt: no-new-privileges` plus `user: 10001:10001`. Langfuse compose secrets come from `.env` (`:?` required expansion) with pinned image tags. `PYTHONPATH=src python src/scripts/publish_space.py --check` asserts the Dockerfile baseline before publishing.

On The-Mailroom:

```bash
MAILROOM_PIPELINE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
MAILROOM_PIPELINE_TOKEN=$MAILROOM_API_TOKEN
MAILROOM_PIPELINE_API_PREFIX=/v1
```

Try-it-out without the visualizer: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`. `GET /health` reports `producer` / `review_resolve` plus the watcher lamp.

### Hugging Face Docker Space (hosted Observatory)

The root `Dockerfile` binds `0.0.0.0:7860` and refuses to start without `MAILROOM_API_TOKEN`. Publish (keys stay in the environment, never the Space git tree):

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python src/scripts/publish_space.py --check
HF_TOKEN=hf_... MAILROOM_API_TOKEN=change-me \
  PYTHONPATH=src python src/scripts/publish_space.py --repo Lucius-Morningstar/mailroom-producer
```

Observatory Space (re-probed 2026-10-06): [`Lucius-Morningstar/mailroom-observatory`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Lucius-Morningstar/mailroom-observatory) at `https://lucius-morningstar-mailroom-observatory.hf.space` — **paused**, returning *"The space is paused, ask a maintainer to restart it"*. The matching producer Space is still **not** on the Hub — publish it with the command above, then set The-Mailroom Space secrets to `https://lucius-morningstar-mailroom-producer.hf.space` and the same token. Keep the producer Space **public** so the Observatory can HTTP-call it; gate every non-health route with the bearer token. Space disk under `/data` is ephemeral — use the compose volume (or a VPS) when parked REVIEW files must survive sleep.

See [`deploy/space/SPACE_README.md`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/tree/main/deploy/space/SPACE_README.md).

## Backup & Restore

The audit log is the compliance record. The pipeline cannot rebuild it, so the backup is the only copy that survives a disk loss. This section covers the SQLite default. The same rules apply to Postgres.

### What to back up

| Artifact                 | Path                  | Purpose                                                                                                         | Frequency                                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Catalog DB               | `data/mailroom.db`    | matters, documents, audit\_log                                                                                  | Daily (or continuous)                              |
| Crash-resume checkpoints | `data/checkpoints.db` | LangGraph in-flight state (only when `MAILROOM_CHECKPOINTER=sqlite` is set; default MemorySaver writes nothing) | Daily                                              |
| Archived documents       | `data/archive/`       | Final durable document copies                                                                                   | Continuous (as docs are archived)                  |
| Manifests                | `data/manifests/`     | Self-contained per-document records (mirror of manifest JSON)                                                   | Daily                                              |
| Mirrored run logs        | `data/langfuse_logs/` | Offline analysis copies of traces                                                                               | Optional — only if you use `sync_langfuse_logs.py` |

### SQLite backup

SQLite files are safe to copy with a consistent snapshot. **Do not** copy a live `.db` file while the watcher/API are writing to it without a safe snapshot mechanism:

```bash
# Recommended: use SQLite's online backup (safe while the service is running)
sqlite3 data/mailroom.db ".backup 'backup/mailroom.db'"
sqlite3 data/checkpoints.db ".backup 'backup/checkpoints.db'"

# Or, stop services, then plain copy:
# (stop watcher + API + ops monitor)
cp data/mailroom.db backup/
cp data/checkpoints.db backup/
```

Schedule a daily snapshot via cron:

```cron
# Daily 2am — safe online snapshot
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/llm-mailroom && \
  mkdir -p backup/$(date +\%Y-\%m-\%d) && \
  sqlite3 data/mailroom.db ".backup 'backup/$(date +\%Y-\%m-\%d)/mailroom.db'" && \
  sqlite3 data/checkpoints.db ".backup 'backup/$(date +\%Y-\%m-\%d)/checkpoints.db'" && \
  cp -R data/archive backup/$(date +\%Y-\%m-\%d)/archive && \
  cp -R data/manifests backup/$(date +\%Y-\%m-\%d)/manifests
```

Retain a rotation window (e.g. 30–90 days) sized to your compliance requirements. The audit log is append-only — backups are the only way to reconstruct it.

### Postgres backup

If using `DATABASE_URL` with Postgres, use `pg_dump`:

```bash
pg_dump -h localhost -U mailroom mailroom > backup/mailroom-$(date +%F).sql
```

### Restore procedure

Restore all artifacts from **one** backup date. The audit chain links each entry to the previous entry. If the catalog DB and the manifests come from different dates, the chain does not verify.

1. Stop the API, the ops monitor, and the dedicated watcher if you use one. This prevents writes during the restore.
2.  Restore the catalog DB. Replace `<date>` with the backup folder name.

    ```bash
    # SQLite
    cp backup/<date>/mailroom.db data/mailroom.db
    cp backup/<date>/checkpoints.db data/checkpoints.db   # only if you use MAILROOM_CHECKPOINTER=sqlite
    # Postgres
    # psql -h localhost -U mailroom mailroom < backup/mailroom-YYYY-MM-DD.sql
    ```
3.  Move the current archive and manifests aside. Then restore them from the same backup.

    ```bash
    mv data/archive data/archive.pre-restore
    mv data/manifests data/manifests.pre-restore
    cp -R backup/<date>/archive data/archive
    cp -R backup/<date>/manifests data/manifests
    ```

    If you copy into a directory that exists, `cp -R` puts the backup inside it (`data/archive/archive`). Newer files also stay next to the restored files. Moving the directories aside prevents both problems.
4. Start the services again.
5. **Verify the audit chain.** Run `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $MAILROOM_API_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/v1/audit/<doc_id>` for some restored documents. Each response must report `"chain_valid": true`. If a response reports `false`, the DB and the manifests come from different dates. Restore again from one date.
6. When the chain verifies, delete the `*.pre-restore` directories.

### Disaster-recovery checklist

* [ ] Archives + manifests + catalog DB backed up from the same point in time
* [ ] Audit chain verified after every restore
* [ ] Backups stored off-host (cloud object storage, WORM bucket, etc.)
* [ ] Test a restore at least quarterly — an untested backup is not a backup
* [ ] Encrypt backups at rest (they contain confidential client documents)

### Logging & Log Rotation

The pipeline emits **structured logs to stdout** (structlog, `LOG_FORMAT=json|pretty`, level `LOG_LEVEL`) — it does not write log files itself. Log file capture, rotation, and retention are the responsibility of the process manager (systemd, supervisord, Docker). Recommended policies:

| Concern       | Recommendation                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Capture**   | Redirect each service's stdout/stderr to a log file (see examples below)                                                                         |
| **Rotation**  | Rotate daily or at 100MB, whichever comes first                                                                                                  |
| **Retention** | Keep 14–30 days (or as required by your retention policy); the audit log in SQLite is the long-term compliance record, logs are operational only |
| **Format**    | Use `LOG_FORMAT=json` in production so rotated logs are machine-parseable                                                                        |

**systemd** (`journald` rotates the logs automatically). `ExecStart` does not accept a `VAR=value` prefix, so set `PYTHONPATH` with `Environment=`:

```ini
[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/llm-mailroom
Environment=PYTHONPATH=src
ExecStart=/path/to/llm-mailroom/.venv/bin/python -m pipeline.watcher
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
```

**supervisord:**

```ini
[program:watcher]
directory=/path/to/llm-mailroom
environment=PYTHONPATH="src"
command=/path/to/llm-mailroom/.venv/bin/python -m pipeline.watcher
stdout_logfile=/var/log/mailroom/watcher.log
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=100MB
stdout_logfile_backups=14
stderr_logfile=/var/log/mailroom/watcher.err.log
stderr_logfile_maxbytes=100MB
stderr_logfile_backups=14
```

**logrotate** (if you redirect output to files manually):

```
/var/log/mailroom/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 30
    compress
    delaycompress
    missingok
    notifempty
    copytruncate
}
```

**JSON logs + rotation:** when `LOG_FORMAT=json`, each line is a self-contained JSON object — safe to rotate at any line boundary, no partial-line concerns.

## Railway

Root [`railway.json`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/tree/main/railway.json) forces the **Dockerfile** builder (multi-stage, non-root, `HEALTHCHECK`) and probes `GET /health`. A [`nixpacks.toml`](https://github.com/Exios66/llm-mailroom/tree/main/nixpacks.toml) exists only as a fallback if a service is accidentally left on Nixpacks.

### Why deploys looked “crashed”

1. **Wrong listen port.** The image defaults `MAILROOM_API_PORT=7860` (Spaces). Railway injects `$PORT` and proxies to that port. The API prefers `PORT` over `MAILROOM_API_PORT` so the process binds where the edge expects.
2. **Missing bearer token.** `MAILROOM_API_HOST=0.0.0.0` (image default) refuses to start without `MAILROOM_API_TOKEN` / `MAILROOM_API_TOKENS` (audit L-2). Without the variable the process exits immediately → Railway `CRASHED`.

### Required service variables

| Variable             | Value                                                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MAILROOM_API_HOST`  | `0.0.0.0` (already in the image)                                  |
| `MAILROOM_API_TOKEN` | shared secret (The-Mailroom `MAILROOM_PIPELINE_TOKEN` must match) |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | production LLM key                                                |

Recommended: Langfuse keys under `auto`, `MAILROOM_BASE_DIR=/data` (attach a volume for durable SQLite), `LOG_FORMAT=json`. On Railway, `auto` skips the local Phoenix fallback unless `PHOENIX_ENDPOINT` is a remote collector.

### Deploy

```bash
railway link   # once
railway variables set MAILROOM_API_TOKEN=... OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
railway up -m "mailroom producer"
# The-Mailroom:
#   MAILROOM_PIPELINE_URL=https://<your-railway-domain>
#   MAILROOM_PIPELINE_TOKEN=$MAILROOM_API_TOKEN
#   MAILROOM_PIPELINE_API_PREFIX=/v1
```

Generate a public domain in the Railway dashboard (or `railway domain`) and point The-Mailroom at it. Health: `curl -sS https://<domain>/health`.

***

## Troubleshooting

### Railway deploy CRASHED / restart loop

* Confirm `MAILROOM_API_TOKEN` is set on the **service** (not only shared).
* Confirm runtime logs show `Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:<PORT>` where `<PORT>` matches Railway’s injected `PORT` (not stuck on 7860).
* Confirm `railway.json` is on the deployed branch (`builder: DOCKERFILE`).

### Watcher not picking up files

* Check that `MAILROOM_BASE_DIR` points to an existing directory
* Verify file extension is in the accepted list (`config/taxonomy.yaml` → `file_extensions`)
* Check watcher logs for errors

### Database errors

* **SQLite:** verify the `data/` directory is writable; the DB files are created automatically. If the DB was created by a different `MAILROOM_BASE_DIR`, point it back or delete the old files.
* **Postgres:** verify `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` and that Postgres is running: `docker compose -f src/config/docker/docker-compose.yml ps`

### Langfuse not showing traces

* Check `OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER` — must be `auto` or `langfuse`
* Check `LANGFUSE_HOST` is correct (cloud: `https://us.cloud.langfuse.com`)
* For self-hosted: verify the Langfuse container is healthy and API keys in `.env` match the Langfuse UI project settings
* The pipeline runs without Langfuse — it degrades gracefully

### Braintrust not showing traces

* Check `OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER=braintrust` and `BRAINTRUST_API_KEY`/`BRAINTRUST_PROJECT` are set
* Braintrust is a no-op until the API key is present

### No traces in `auto` mode after dropping cloud keys

With no `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` or `BRAINTRUST_API_KEY`, `auto` falls through to the local Arize Phoenix backend (cost-free) **on a laptop**. On Railway, local Phoenix is skipped (no collector). To see traces:

* Start Phoenix locally: `phoenix serve`, then open `http://localhost:6006`
* Verify `PHOENIX_TRACING` is not `disabled` and `PHOENIX_ENDPOINT` matches Phoenix
* Set `OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER=phoenix` explicitly if you want to force it
* Set `OBSERVABILITY_PROVIDER=none` only if you want tracing fully off
* On Railway, set Langfuse keys (or a remote `PHOENIX_ENDPOINT`)

### LLM provider errors

* OpenRouter: verify `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and check usage/credits at openrouter.ai
* Ollama: verify the model is pulled (`ollama pull qwen3:7b`) and the service is running
* Check `DEFAULT_PROVIDER` env var isn't accidentally overriding your intended provider
