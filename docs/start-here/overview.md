# Overview

**Start here** is for readers who are new to the Mailroom. It covers what the system does, a first run, and the terms the other pages use. For exact settings and commands, go to the [Pipeline reference](../pipeline-reference-llm-mailroom/architecture.md).

## What the Mailroom does

The Mailroom is a document-processing system for legal and business paperwork. A document arrives (by upload, by watched folder, or by email), and the Mailroom:

1. **Takes it in.** It transcribes PDFs and images, cleans the text, and records where it came from.
2. **Classifies it.** A sorter agent decides which of five document classes it belongs to (`contract`, `merger_agreement`, `corporate_record`, `correspondence`, `insurance_claim`) and which subclass inside that class.
3. **Extracts fields.** A specialist agent for that class pulls out the fields that matter: parties, dates, amounts, obligations, claim numbers, and so on.
4. **Checks its own work.** Confidence gates, a judge and an arbiter, a "boss" escalation agent, and a human review queue catch low-confidence or conflicting results.
5. **Files it.** A procedural reporter writes the report and updates the catalog. The archivist files the document with a hash-chained audit entry, so later tampering is detectable.

Every step is traced (Langfuse, Braintrust or Arize Phoenix), every prompt is versioned, and every claim about quality is backed by a deterministic score.

### Why the pipeline is shaped this way

The design follows from one constraint: a wrong answer about a contract or an insurance claim costs more than a slow answer. Four decisions fall out of it.

* **Spend model calls only where they pay for themselves.** A clean document costs exactly two LLM generations: one by the sorter, one by the class specialist. Transcription, guardrails, the report, the catalog row and the audit entry are procedural code. The judge and the arbiter run only when an extraction lands in an ambiguous confidence band. Only the documents that need the expensive checks get them.
* **Make the confidence thresholds depend on the stakes.** The default gate sends a classification straight on at `0.97` or above and retries it below `0.88`. Contracts, merger agreements and insurance claims use a stricter `0.98` / `0.90`. Corporate records (`0.96` / `0.86`) and correspondence (`0.95` / `0.85`) use a looser gate. The values live in `config/taxonomy.yaml`, so changing a risk appetite is a config edit, not a code change.
* **Never let a bad result pass silently.** Guardrails run after every LLM call. A violation does not raise an error; it lowers the confidence below the routing threshold, so the ordinary retry-or-review path handles it. A document that cannot be resolved lands in the `review` bin for a person, rather than being archived with a guess.
* **Make the record trustworthy after the fact.** Each audit entry carries the hash of the one before it, so editing or deleting a past entry breaks the chain and `verify_chain` reports it. The model's work can be questioned later, and the log of what it did cannot be quietly rewritten.

The same philosophy explains the optional ModernBERT fast path. It is *fail-open*: if the flag is off, the package is missing, or the model errors, intake continues with the deterministic clerk. A speed optimization is never allowed to become a new way for a document to fail.

## Why there are so many repositories

The pipeline is only one part of the work. A production LLM system also needs these parts:

* datasets with ground truth;
* one shared scoring library;
* an experiment loop for prompts;
* an evaluation harness for each node;
* a cheaper ML classifier for easy documents;
* a way to run everything offline;
* tools to watch it run.

Each of those grew up as its own repository with its own release train.

In August 2026 they were gathered into one monorepo, **Digital-Mailroom**, which holds every package as a git subtree inside a single `uv` workspace. The monorepo is now where cross-repo development happens; the individual `Exios66/*` repositories remain the release vehicles that deployments install from.

## The constellation at a glance

### Hub and coordination

| Repository                                                         | What it is                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Digital-Mailroom](../repository-guides/repos/digital-mailroom.md) | The monorepo. Every package below lives in `packages/`. Holds the cross-repo task board (`governance/TASKS.md`) and the served Dispatch Board. |
| [mailroom-issues](../repository-guides/repos/mailroom-issues.md)   | The issue hub for anything that spans more than one repository: epics, RFCs, and the label taxonomy. No code.                                  |
